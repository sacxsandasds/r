Background:
Episode 20 opens within seconds of where we left off with the surprise drone attacks at the end of episode 19. This is the big one - the missile event that has been endlessly discussed, studied, wargamed and worried over for a decade. Will China's intermediate and long-range ballistic missiles, including the feared DF-26B "Carrier Killers" work as advertised? Will the US's "Golden Dome" Tiered Missile Defense Architecture work as advertised? This is what I was looking to explore. 

A TON of time went into episode 20, from numerous interviews with various SMEs, to pouring through volumes of articles, to playtesting for timing details for the script using the game Command Modern Operations. The scope and scale of events in this episode proved fascinating, daunting and deeply troubling. 

Commentary:
Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess or through open resources such as Google Translation, etc. As always, uniforms are not exact. The rank shown on the uniforms of some of the characters are also inaccurate because they are not available in the gaming platforms used. Some of the kit and equipment shown are representations because of limited available mods. In some instances, replacements had to be made, including two scenes in particular where I had to use ARMA instead of DCS and had to use the only carrier model available, which is not the GW. I'm mostly a One Man Show, so I do what I can with the time/resources available.

Gaming platforms used for the filming of this episode included DCS, ARMA3, Command Modern Operations and Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Background:
I think of this episode as H-Hour (minus 1). It is the attack that will pave the way for the next episode when the missile blitz begins. For this episode I wanted to highlight the vulnerabilities we face through cyberattacks, including how our own vehicles could be used against us. Also, I wanted to show how drones will be used ubiquitously and to illustrate that their reach will be far and used in ways we may not be prepared for (yet). There are no longer 'front lines'.

Commentary:
Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess or through open resources such as Google Translation, etc. As always, uniforms are not exact. The rank shown on the uniforms of some of the characters are also inaccurate because they are not available in the gaming platforms used. Some of the drones and vehicles shown are representations because of limited available mods. In some instances, replacements had to be made. For example, some of the drone explosions were not possible or effective through DCS or ARMA, so bombs had to be used. In some cases, the explosions are bigger than what they would be in reality, but for cinematic reasons (and simply so that they could be seen at night), bigger 'booms' were needed. Other gaming platform limitations meant that the license plates on some of the vehicles are incorrect, and background city-scape signage is in the wrong language. I do what I can with what I have!

Gaming platforms used for the filming of this episode included DCS, ARMA3, Cold Waters and Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Background:

This is the bridging episode that takes us from China's gamble regarding the quarantine, the US’s attempt to break it, and what comes next: open war. In this episode, I wanted to show how the momentum of events are affecting both sides and a behind-the-curtain look at how decisions were made. Within that, I was also looking to highlight how both sides misread the other while being influenced by their own agendas (personally and politically), as well by misinformation, disinformation and missteps. Definitely on my mind while writing this were events of late spring and summer of 1914 in the weeks leading to World War 1, where once Serbia and Austria-Hungary began to mobilize, momentum took over, spiraling Europe into war. Finally, I wanted to introduce the US Marines unit to the story, who we will revisit in much further detail later in the season!  I know this one was a slower-paced episode, but it was really necessary to make that connection to all the episodes coming. In episode 19… things begin to cook. 

Commentary:

Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess or through open resources such as Google Translation, etc. As always, uniforms are not exact. The rank shown on the uniforms of some of the characters are also inaccurate because they are not available in the gaming platforms used. Some of the ships shown are not current versions because of limited available mods. In some instances, replacements had to be made.

Gaming platforms used for the filming of this episode included DCS, ARMA3, Cold Waters, Command Modern Operations and Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Background:

What if the Berlin Airlift or the blockade of Cuba had not only failed, but ignited a war? This is what was in my mind when preparing for this episode. I also wanted to explore how, despite characters on both sides of the Pacific not wishing war, events can quickly spiral beyond control through miscommunication, mistakes and overconfidence. Lastly, I wanted to take a first, hard look at how fast and lethal a modern naval battle could be - in particular when in such close proximity where the benefits of range and SAMs are reduced. The 1980’s tanker war and the Falklands War both were great resources for this episode. 

Commentary:

Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess or through open resources such as Google Translation, etc. As always, uniforms are not exact. The rank shown on the uniforms of some of the characters are also inaccurate because they are not available in the gaming platforms used. Some of the ships, kit, etc., shown may be not be correct because of limited available mods. In some instances, replacements had to be made. I have to work with what I have!

Lastly, for those in Poland who may be saying WTF, my intent here is not to throw the Polish Navy under the bus. The theme of this episode is about how the policymakers on all sides misjudged and miscalculated things that, as a result, spun us into the situation we are (story-wise) in and placed those on the front lines in harm's way. So why pick Poland? After much research and discussion, Poland was the best fit politically and has precedence conducting joint counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean. Being at the end of their original tour and completely tossed into an operation they hadn't trained nor prepared for, mistakes would be inevitable for anyone in that spot.

Background:
A great deal is happening in this episode. The general idea behind it is that as the quarantine takes effect and with China moving to further isolate Taiwan, both the US and China begin to misunderstand and miscalculate the other and, under increasing pressure, make decisions that will have grave effects in this episode, and more importantly, the next. I also wanted to highlight the local and global economic impacts, the uncertainty of geopolitics when it comes to friends and allies in the region, and the technologies used in undersea ISR and sabotage. And though the script for this episode was planned many months ago... it has been outpaced by real-world current events in the Baltic Sea, North Sea and off Taiwan! It's hard to keep up and keep ahead.

Commentary:
Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess or through open resources such as Google Translation, etc. As always, uniforms are NOT exact. The rank shown on the uniforms of some of the characters are also inaccurate because they are not available in the gaming platforms used. Some of the UUVs are kit-bashed SDVs made to look like UUV/AUVs only because there are none available in the gaming platforms. If you look close and squint, those explosions of UUVs are actually old Russian subs. And yep, that H-6 is dropping a bomb, not a smart mine. No such thing exists yet in DCS.  :)

Lastly, as always, there is only so much I can do as a one-man-show in putting this series together to get it perfectly “right”. The gaming platforms I use are limited, the mods available within them can be limiting as well, so there are times when a rank or uniform might not be right, or a version of equipment, etc.  I work with what I have, in the time that I have, so I ask for a bit of grace in focusing more on the story, tone and feel. That said, I’m always happy to receive constructive criticism. This is all about making the story and presentation better. Thanks!

Background:
There’s much to tell in this episode, laying the groundwork for the entire season - so for those looking for beginning-to-end action, this one is a slow-burn. To begin, I wanted to start with China’s “justification” for the quarantine and in a way that would be the most troublesome to Taiwan and its allies. In talking to my network of SMEs, an invasion of the Kinmen Islands - and in particular using unidentified forces (though clearly PRC), would do nicely. The difficult challenge for Taiwan, the US, Australia, UK and Japan would be how to respond without going kinetic. I also wanted to give a peek into the decision making process in Washington, most notably, their debate about Taiwan’s willingness to fight and the US commitment to Taiwan’s defense. Toward that, I wanted to insert a nod to the very small but important US State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR), who doesn’t receive much love, but from my own research… does some amazing work. Lastly, a ton of time went into the episode, from pouring through historical documents of NSC meetings, to interviews with subject matter experts, think tank white papers… the list goes on, all before the script, filming and editing even began. To speed up production, the creator of the YouTube Channel, FIXEDIT, offered his valuable time and knowledge of DCS, to film several of the scenes based on my script. A HUGE thank you to him. That, alone, cut my time in filming by a third. Otherwise, this episode would not have gone out until February.

Some initial comments about episode 15:

Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess or through open resources such as Google Translation, etc. 

As always, uniforms are not always exact. Also, for the Little Green Men on Kinmen, I purposefully bastardized the PRC’s uniform to make them unidentifiable, but remain using some of their standard kit. 

Taiwanese and Chinese faces. The gaming platform, ARMA3, has a few mods that provide regional faces, but they are few and far between, and not always great. In the time and resources I have… I get what I get.  That also goes toward 3D models of female characters. I hope that at some point there will be more available in ARMA.

That drone that hit the Orion seemed to be going insanely fast. Yep! Filming that scene was challenging. What eventually “worked” was firing a missile at the Orion, then superimposing a drone. Not ideal, but gets the point across.

Lastly, as always, there is only so much I can do as a one-man-show in putting this series together to get it perfectly “right”. The gaming platforms I use are limited, the mods available within them can be limiting as well, so there are times when a rank or uniform might not be right, or a version of equipment, etc.  I work with what I have, in the time that I have, so I ask for a bit of grace in focusing more on the story, tone and feel. That said, I’m always happy to receive constructive criticism. This is all about making the story and presentation better. Thanks!

August 3rd, 2032. Russia launches a surprise attack on the Baltics, kicking off a third world war that will begin in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but soon spread from the arctic to the UK, to the heart of America. This documentary-style series takes you into battle from the eyes of the warfighters, to the strategic decision-makers, providing a terrifying and plausible look at a hypothetical Third World War scenario. Coming in Part 2: the war will turn to the Indo-Pacific as China eyes Taiwan.

Movie project background:
Originally I did not plan to create a full-length movie from the season 1 episodes. But as episode 4 turned to 8…11, 14… it became more clear to me that I should give it a try and see if it worked. Would it flow? Would people sit through the whole thing? Would they care? You all will surely let me know.

But before I started to create the full-length movie, first I had to address multiple issues and errors from the individual episodes that needed fixing. Some were small (a poorly chosen word here-and-there), some were large (the HMS… being a big one, or the incorrect use of a Lithuanian name). Many were brought to me by you, the viewers. Also, some of the early graphics and edits just bugged me and I felt needed changing. Did I get them all? Could I get them all? Nope. Some things (I’m pointing to you, UK sub commander), I couldn’t change because the tools/mods for the video simply are not available. But if it was remotely do-able… I did it.

One thing you will see is that the content from episode 13 is not in here. That episode, presented in an entirely different voice and style, was meant to be a stand-alone. I jokingly call it my WW3 Christmas Special. Though the story does flow with the full-length timeline and very much supports the lead-up to the season finale’, I thought the style and voice change was too jarring for the viewer. Also, I think we all get it, even with the removal of episode 13, that Colonel Nagamov is a bad dude and we all (including me) wanted to see his end. Enough said.

Lastly, I wanted to provide a sneak peak of what’s coming as the story turns to the Indo-Pacific. An unbelievable amount of time, research and interviewing has gone into planning the next season of the story. More on that to come.

As always: pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess. Uniforms and equipment are not always exact as the gaming platforms I use are limited, as well as the mods available within them. I’m quite literally a one-man-show and work with what I have, in the time that I have, so I ask for a bit of grace if it’s not perfect. That said, I’m always happy to receive constructive criticism.

Background:
Well folks, season 1 has all been building to this. Originally I had this finale set to be a two-parter, but the more I got into it, the more I felt the pacing needed to be all one-and-done. As with each episode, I try to provide a cautionary glimpse into what a conflict may look like, both today and in 2032. For episode 14 I focused on intelligence; HUMINT, SIGNET, GEOINT, IMINT, OSINT, etc, and how AI technology will vastly speed up the process of linking these firehoses of data into information that is integrated, pertinent and actionable.

Lastly, I wanted to provide a sneak peak of what’s coming in season 2 as the story turns to the Indo-Pacific. I can’t overstate the amount of time, research and interviewing that’s gone into planning next season.

Some initial comments about episode 14:

- Pronunciations of places, names and translations are my best guess.

- As always, uniforms are not always exact. You’ll note that the Rear Admiral at the end is wearing a flight suit. That was deliberate, and from my research, plausible - though the rank and name are stock that come with the skin modification. 

- The nano-drone shown is based on a real thing, though the current one does not have (at least to my knowledge) an explosive capability. Mine does. :)

- Why are Nagamov’s feet ‘buried’ in one of the last scenes? For those who know gaming platforms, this is called ‘clipping’. With a lot more time and work, I could have found a way around it, but with 92 scenes to shoot… there wasn’t time. 

Lastly, as always, there is only so much I can do as a one-man-show in putting this series together to get it perfectly “right”. The gaming platforms I use are limited, the mods available within them can be limiting as well, so there are times when a rank or uniform might not be right, or a version of equipment, etc.  I work with what I have, in the time that I have, so I ask for a bit of grace in focusing more on the story, tone and feel. That said, I’m always happy to receive constructive criticism. This is all about making the story and presentation better. Thanks!

Background:
The idea for this episode came to me near the very beginning of my series, over a year ago. The horrible events that took place in Bucha, Irpin and Mariupol were heavy on my mind, and I felt that a much more human story needed to be told of what was happening in my hypothetical war. Frankly, however, I wasn't sure it would "work". Trying to make something emotional through platforms like ARMA3 was going to be tricky, at best. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the result.

Some initial comments:

Latvian, Italian and other pronunciations are my best guess (and therefore, the AI narrators as well). If I messed up, my apologies.

The actual river in Lievarde is wider than what I could do using the maps in ARMA3. In one scene, it's hard not to think, "why not just swim across it?!"

In reality, the Super Market sign atop the store would be in Latvian.

Arvils, the paramedic, continues wearing his bright red uniform, even when trying to sneak through Lievarde. Not exactly smart, I know. I thought of that while filming, but thought it would be too much and take too much time to have to tell the viewer that he changed into something different, and worried it might confuse viewers later in the film.

Why are almost all the extras 20-something men? Unfortunately, that's the majority of 'characters' available in ARMA3, being it's a military first person shooter game. There are very few female characters and fewer older characters. It's frustrating.

Why the change in narrator and point-of-view? That requires a longer answer, and I'm thinking of doing a behind-the-scenes video about this episode in particular. But one of the primary reasons was that I wanted to set a different tone, catch the viewer off-guard and make it clear that this is a stand-alone episode. Also, I felt that by making a first-person narrative, it would add more emotion to the story.

Did Arvils survive? Time will tell. Will we see Debra again? Perhaps!

Lastly, as always, there is only so much I can do as a one-man-show in putting this series together to get it perfectly “right”. The gaming platforms I use are limited, the mods available within them can be limiting as well, so there are times when a rank or uniform might not be right, or a version of equipment, etc.  I work with what I have, in the time that I have, so I ask for a bit of grace in focusing more on the story, tone and feel. That said, I’m always happy to receive constructive criticism. This is all about making the story and presentation better. Thanks!

Background:
This episode looks at the question: what would happen if (like Ukraine in the opening hours of the war when Zelenskyy refused the US advice to evacuate - his "ammunition instead of a ride" comment) - instead, what if the President of Lithuania took the US up on that offer. A pretty controversial decision.  I'll leave it up to the viewer to decide whether it was right or wrong. For the President, do you save your city from destruction, or evacuate to a different part of the country and operate on-the-run, or do you fully evacuate and wait it out until NATO can retake the Baltics? 

Commentary:
Soccer vs. football. The narrator is from the UK, so why am I calling the field a soccer field? I bounced back and forth on this while writing it, but came to the conclusion that because I am from the U.S., it needs to be written as such. If I was to fully immerse myself and "pretend" to write the script from a UK POV, I would get a TON of things/terms, etc. wrong. So... soccer it is. :)

Pronunciations. Oh boy, there are several in this episode that I probably butchered. I (try) to determine what they should be but, 1) even researching it, the results aren't always accurate and 2) the AI narrator struggles to get it "right". Also, sespite my best research attempt, I have come to learn since posting this video that Simonyte is a female Lithuanian name. My mistake!

Female characters. Why so few? Simply put, the 3D models available within ARMA3 are AWFUL. I have yet to find a group that works well as civilians beyond women in tracksuits or mini-skirts. Seriously. Ugh. I'm still looking for anyone who has created a better mod, but in the meantime... I'm stuck.

Night vision gear used by pilots is an approximation based on 2032.

Why am I showing the flight lead sitting in the right seat (as opposed to the left seat pilot)? I was corrected on this by Ian Brown. As he put it, "while the pilots wiggles the stick, the flight lead is doing their thing."

Lastly, please keep in mind that the equipment, “actors”, uniform rank, etc., in my video may not be perfect. Though I try to get it right, sometimes there isn’t a mod or 3D model for what’s needed. Or, I might get something wrong. I’m a One Man Show here and I’m doing my best, so I ask for some grace. That said, if you see something that I might be able to address in future episodes, let me know. Constructive criticism is ALWAYS welcome.

The Next World War is a documentary series that takes a terrifying and realistic look at a hypothetical Third World War scenario. 

Background:
As always, each episode starts with an idea. For Episode 11 my idea was, "what if in retaliation and to throw political sand in the gears, Russia launches a cyberattack on the US commercial aviation industry?" And as always, the next step is, "OK... so how would they do that?" I role-played several scenarios, starting with shutting down the NOTAM or reservation systems (though not through cyberattacks, both systems have experienced temporary failures before that essentially halted or disrupted air traffic). Then I turned to flight performance data that provides the crew with the information needed to properly set up the aircraft for takeoff. At first I considered just "killing" the system, which would have slowed and disrupted operations. But then a thought struck me. What if instead of killing the system, the system provided the crew with bad (dangerous) data? What would happen? In the vast majority of cases (99%), not much. But if takeoff performance was critical because of a shorter runway, high density altitude, high heat and humidity and a new-ish crew who haven't flown into that airport often, well then you might have .5% that don't discover the issue until they are at rotate (Vr) speed and at that speed, there isn't enough runway left to stop. At that point, the crew is committed to takeoff, however anemic that is. With approximately 45,000 flights a day and a bit of back-of-the-napkin math, you could assume that roughly 2000-ish planes could be preparing to takeoff at any given (day) time. Take .5% of those and you get 10 aircraft that would pass through each ‘swiss cheese’ hole toward a crash.

Here's a good article that gives a bit more detail of the risks:

https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2019-05-22/ainsight-takeoff-performance-system-errors

Now, some might later argue that this couldn't happen. And on a technical level either now or by 2032, that might be. This episode is not meant to be a technical white paper. For me, as with every episode, it has to answer the question, "is this plausible?" The answer I've found based on the information I've learned, is yes. Whether it's my approach, or some other, the possibility of an attack on the commercial aviation industry is very plausible and real. And because my series is meant to be a cautionary tale, let's hope we catch and close those holes before this episode becomes something less than fiction.

Commentary:
The settings in the cockpit do not reflect actual settings. I only have so much time to learn all the things and so I have to prioritize where that time goes. Learning to configure a passenger jet wasn't one of them.

Careful viewers will note that though the narration states runway 30 at Tucson, the graphics in X-Plane show runway 29. That's because shifts in the Earth's magnetic field over time require runway number changes and so the download of the Tucson Airport had old data.

For those who know X-Plane and wondering where the "explosion" came from because X-Plane doesn't model them: the explosion was green-screened in ARMA3 and edited in.

The runway overrun graphic is a dramatization. That said, the "lie" would have to be 20% or greater to cause a possible overrun.

The uniforms for the pilots are what I could get.

There is yet no model (that I'm aware of) for a sub-launched hypersonic missile in Cold Waters, DCS or ARMA3. I had to improvise. The booster phase shown is actually a Russian SLBM. Luckily, someone did create the glide vehicle model in DCS, so this video is a blend.

For episode time reasons, I could not get into the effects on the aviation industry and the economy as a whole after the attack, which would be massive.

The Next World War is a documentary series that takes a terrifying and realistic look at a hypothetical Third World War scenario. 

Creator notes and commentary:
- First, a thank you to Robert Wilkerson (call sign “Skinner”), a former harrier pilot, for his insight and information for this and future episodes, and for catching an important error in THIS episode.
- ERROR discovered: In real-life, NATO SACEUR and US Commander EUCOM are actually the same person, wearing two hats. I have them as two characters. Viewers and a friend of mine caught the error, but it was after I posted, so... that one's on me! Sorry folks.
- I couldn't find the successor to the Marine AAV (the new ACV), so I had to improvise.
- I don't have General uniforms for US, UK, etc. - so I had to go with what I got.
- The Russian missiles taking down "glide bombs"... weren't glide bombs. I had to improvise with drones.
- The F35s are dropping JASSMs for the story, though visually they look like bombs - thus calling "rifle" instead of "bombs away".
- Does this airstrike scenario cover all the bases for reality? Nope. To keep the story moving, I couldn't include everything - but it gives enough of the tension and flavor of what's plausible to make it exciting and watchable. Would there be more downed NATO planes in reality? Maybe, but my thinking was that most of the weapons dropped would be dropped while still well inside the Baltics, reducing risk. The losses would mostly be bombs and missiles being knocked down while heading in.

Lastly, please keep in mind that the equipment, “actors”, uniform rank, etc., in my video may not be perfect. Though I try to get it right, sometimes there isn’t a mod or 3D model for what’s needed. Or, I might get something wrong. I’m a One Man Show here and I’m doing my best, so I ask for some grace. That said, if you see something that I might be able to address in future episodes, let me know. Constructive criticism is ALWAYS welcome.

The Next World War is a documentary series that takes a terrifying and realistic look at a hypothetical Third World War scenario. 

Creator notes and commentary:

First, a thank you to Ian Brown, creator of the wargame, Maneuver Warfare, for giving me insight into the challenges of the modern battlefield. His game can be found here:
https://dietzfoundation.org/product/maneuver-warfare/

The Russian UGVs shown in the episode were actually theoretical manned APCs within the ARMA3 game platform. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a mod out there of a large-scale UGV that fit the need, and I did not want to use the same UGV for both sides. So, I improvised. 

Lastly, please keep in mind that the equipment, “actors”, uniform rank, etc., in my video may not be perfect. Though I try to get it right, sometimes there isn’t a mod or 3D model for what’s needed.

The Next World War is a documentary series that takes a terrifying and realistic look at a hypothetical Third World War scenario. 

Creator notes and commentary:
There may be a question from viewers about why I had the aircraft landing around Riga, instead of having the airborne units parachute in. Wouldn’t landing those monster aircraft at a known location be risky? Yes. But my thinking there was that because the city was not (yet) contested, the major risk would be from mid-to-long range missiles. So what created more risk: having the parachuted troops gathering on the ground, assembling their gear where they could be a major target, or offload quickly at the airport with air defense coverage, and get the troops dispersed that much faster? I chose the latter. Right or wrong. There also may be a question about the low US casualty count. Again, because the landing wasn’t contested and with some cyber deception, the first day casualties would be relatively low in my opinion. That number will surely change in the days ahead.

Lastly, please keep in mind that the equipment, “actors”, uniforms, rank, etc., in my video may not be perfect. Though I try to get it right, sometimes there isn’t a mod or 3D model for what’s needed (example: the boat and sub drones in episode 8!). Or, I might get something wrong. I try to catch it, but “this is all R&amp;D for me”. I’m doing my best, so I ask for some grace. That said, if you see something that I might be able to address in future episodes, let me know. Constructive criticism is ALWAYS welcome.

The Next World War is a documentary series that takes a terrifying and realistic look at a hypothetical Third World War scenario. 

Commentary from the author: my original plan was to have episode 7 be the entire NATO landing. But what I found in writing the script was that in order to give the plan context and depth, the script chewed up the entire allocated time, which I try to keep to around 6-ish minutes so that I can put out one these episodes each month (each takes about 60 hours or so). So I understand if some were hoping to leap right into the action this episode. So was I, originally! But with this episode done, I can now focus on JUST the invasion the next couple of episodes. Thanks.

Episode 1 of World War 3 begins with a sudden Russian invasion of the Baltic NATO countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in August of 2032. But that is only the beginning of a war that will stretch from Europe to Taiwan.

The world is about to find out.
